# Waze User Churn Analysis

This repository contains a project completed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The program focuses on developing skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools and services. Each project spans the whole set of seven courses, focuses on applying the knowledge gained from the corresponding course and showcases practical skills in data analysis, data transformation, data visualization, and machine learning.

## Background on the Waze scenario

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely.

You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. In your role, you will analyze user data and develop a machine learning model that predicts user churn.

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as:

- Who are the users most likely to churn?
- Why do users churn?
- When do users churn?

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why.

Your insights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.

### Overview

1. Project Proposal and Milestones: - Create a project proposal outlining milestones for the tasks within the churn project. - Consider the audience, project goals, team dynamics, and the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Communicate, Execute) stages while planning project deliverables.

2. Dataframe Building and Descriptive Statistics: - Build a dataframe using the churn dataset provided by Waze. - Examine the data type of each column in the dataset. - Gather descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and characteristics of the churn data.

3. EDA, Data Cleaning, and Visualization Selection: - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning tasks for the churn project. - Select and build appropriate visualization type(s) to explore variables and relationships within the data. - Create plots and visualizations to effectively communicate insights and patterns to the Waze data team.

4. Hypothesis Testing for Churn Data: - Conduct hypothesis testing on the churn dataset to investigate specific research questions. - Determine the most suitable hypothesis testing method that serves the data and the goals of the churn project. - Document and communicate the findings and implications of the hypothesis testing to the Waze data team.

5. Regression Model Building for Churn Project: - Develop a regression model for the churn project using the Waze churn project data. - Determine the appropriate type of regression model based on the project requirements. - Utilize Waze's churn project data to build and train the regression model.

6. Final Machine Learning Model for Churn Project: - Lead the final tasks for the churn project, including feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. - Implement advanced techniques and algorithms to improve the machine learning model's performance. - Evaluate the final model and provide insights and recommendations based on the evaluation results.
